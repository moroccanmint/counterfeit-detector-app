# KAuth (Counterfeit Detection Application for Philippine Peso Banknote
using Image Processing through Convolutional Neural Network)

As technology advances, methods of banknote counterfeiting also evolve, posing a
significant threat to economic stability. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas reported the
confiscation of â‚±7.69 million worth of counterfeit banknotes over the past decade. The
circulation of counterfeit currency can lead to increased inflation, depreciation of legitimate
currency, and misleading estimates of money supply, affecting both national and
international economies. To address these challenges, a mobile application has been
developed for automated counterfeit detection of Philippine banknotes, focusing on the onethousand eNGC peso denomination. The solution implements a convolutional neural network
(CNN) architecture for image processing and deep learning, utilizing transfer learning. Using
a dataset of 2,000 photographs comprising genuine and counterfeit banknotes, two models
were developed: a Base Model and an Enhanced Model. The Enhanced Model outperformed
the Base Model, achieving higher training and validation accuracies. In classification
performance, the Enhanced Model demonstrated superior performance compared to the Base
Model across all evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score). The Enhanced
Model exhibited improved learning efficiency, better generalization to unseen data, and a
superior ability to minimize false positives while maintaining perfect recall. The developed
mobile application successfully completed unit, integration, and system testing. A survey of
35 participants using the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire rated it 1.33, indicating
a very satisfactory user experience.
